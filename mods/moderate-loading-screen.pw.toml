description = "Performance impact: Minimal\n\nDescription: Makes the icons of installed mods fall down the loading screen like snowflakes. Includes a few configuration options like showing every mod only once, hiding libraries, and changing the background color. I'd recommend installing the actual Mod Menu mod to access the configs."
