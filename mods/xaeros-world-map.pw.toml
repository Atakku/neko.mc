description = "Performance impact: Minimal\n\nDescription: Xaero's World Map mod adds a self-writing fullscreen map to your Minecraft client. Works as a separate mod but is a lot better with Xaero's Minimap. The reason why it's available separately is to keep Xaero's Minimap as light-weight as possible. This mod is mostly client-sided. Installing it on the server side is optional for some additional features like world identification."
