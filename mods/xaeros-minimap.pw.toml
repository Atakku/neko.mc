description = "Performance impact: Minimal\n\nDescription: Unlike many other minimap mods, Xaero's minimap keeps the aesthetic of vanilla Minecraft, which helps it be a more seamless addition to the game. It is also the first rotating square minimap for Minecraft. Among a wide variety of customization settings, there is an option for a circle-shaped minimap and a separate setting for locking the minimap's rotation (using a direction arrow instead)."
