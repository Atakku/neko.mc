# Obsolete mods (no longer needed since 1.19.4/1.20.x)
- [lazydfu](https://modrinth.com/mod/lazydfu) is no longer needed as Mojang optimized DFU initialization
- [starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight) no longer needed on client, **but** possibly can still benefit the server

- removed every-compat for now (too many blocks)
